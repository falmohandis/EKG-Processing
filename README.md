The mini-project is part of a larger project to create a specific series of machine learning and deep learning methods to process EKG data to classify disease states.

For now, I am using this repository to generate a simple pipeline to process multi-head EKG data in general. Model design will be highly data-specific, i.e. the modelling will depend on how the data is structured. 

So, this repository will really serve to just help with the tasks of feature engineering (in the case of Machine Learning models) as well as creating a functional data pipeline.
